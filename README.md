## Lessons Learned

Lessons learned from deep learning concepts such as CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and MNIST include understanding the power of convolutional layers for spatial hierarchies, the importance of sequential memory in recurrent networks, the potential for generating synthetic data with GANs, the foundational dataset for image classification with MNIST, the efficiency gains of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the ease of use and flexibility of Keras for building neural networks, grasping the fundamental principles of TensorFlow for efficient computation, and appreciating logistic regression as a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification.

Lessons learned from operating a differential drive robot, such as an omni-directional robot, include mastering precise control of individual wheel speeds to navigate effectively, understanding the impact of wheel slippage on overall maneuverability, and optimizing algorithms for seamless trajectory planning in diverse environments.
